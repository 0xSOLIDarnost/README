# What is SOLIDarnost?

"Solidaranost" is a russian word for 'solidarity'
also "Solidarnost" was a name for a polish trade union, which has been overthrown soviet rejime in poland


Main focus for this organisation is to create independent mechanism, which allow people to fund independent organisation and control it by vote mechanism (DAO)
It is initiative from EthereumRussia (https://t.me/eth_ru) & Distributed (https://t.me/distributed) communities in telegram


Current readme & work plan TBA

If you want to join the development -- you are welcome to write about it in telegram chats or in issues section of this repository


If you have any ideas about what DAO's we should take as a template and what functionality they may have -- please join our telegram chat or make an issue about it (in this project)


## Organisational structure and politics question

It's a very complicated question, because most of developers usually stay out from political sphere, but we can't stay in this position anymore.

I suggest the following scenario:

1. Basically it's a project 'from developers to developers' so we intent to create mechanisms to give communities (and telegram groups, discord chats etc) ability to fund and control DAO's via chat-bot interfaces. **This is a main goal and it is not political by itself**
2. We assume that this organisation could have a few repositories of different DAO projects related to different communities (and such communities could have different goals, even political ones)
3. Goal of future DAO related to Distributed community is to sustain connection of russia to global internet in case of possible global government shutdown.
4. We acknowledge that there is a possibility, that this instruments can (and probably will) used to create and manage *revolutionary organisation with goal of overthrowing dictatorship rejimes of Putin in Russia and Lukashenko in Belorussia*. 
**However** we assume that if such organisation would be created using our instruments -- they will be very precautious and **will not discuss their movements or actions in public**. This github organisation is focused on **creating instruments**, but not for any extremist actions (because we want to *protect* any developers and protesters from Russia and Belorussia, which can be *targeted* for government terrorism in this rejimes).
5. If you want to join the developer list -- do this in chat or in a special issue
6. If you want to join as anonymous developer -- create new account using **proton mail**.
